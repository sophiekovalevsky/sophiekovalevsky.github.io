									If you think in this way... when you grab a book and start reading it, you will get access to a brain of someone else that have invested at least I would say, three years of their life to research, analyze, and polish the content they are offering as a book. I do believe that <strong>reading is knowledge </strong>and it's one of the most accessible ways that you can satisfy your appetite to know how everything works. There are really great 20 USD books about literature, history, general science that you can start to read, and in the technical field of hardware / embedded you can by 100 USD dollars have the privelige to know all the intrincate issues that remarkable engineers had to face in their craft and read by first hand how they solved, so then you can test same situation and corraborate that within your own experience, don't you think this is amazing?

									I created this section to share with you my thoughts about several books that in someway or another touched my mind. I don't want my thoughts to be spread across only with people I know, but with any human beign that may be interested in them. I'm not an expert in everything, neither in my professional realm, I just consider myself a relentless treeking learner that is always looking for better ways to explore the woods of this world. Welcome to my little <strong>library of Alexandria</strong>, hope you can enjoy it.

									<h4>Obsessive Genius by Barbara Goldsmith</h4>

									<p>This is one of those books that you can easily read 20 pages every night or even more can it's really easy-to-go.</p>

									<p>It's a book split in short chapters that explain the vicisitudes of a brilliant human being that discovered the radium and polonium elements even though when she started university at 24 in a country different to the one that saw her born.</p>

									<p>An example of determination and perseverance to reach a goal that changed dramatically the way humans were observing science.</p>

									<p>I discovered the book thanks to this <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?185824-1/obsessive-genius-world-marie-curie" target="_blank">mind blowing interview</a> and right after finished it I knew I need it to have book and I don't regret it.</p>

									<p>This is not a book that went into the trenches of physics or chemestry, you won't see any technical formulation whatsoever. Hence, it's not a technical book but rather, a well written book about the inner world of a woman scientist that battle up with all her strength to achieve as much as she could in aim to cure cancer, even though radium it's not beind used anymore for that purpose.</p>

									<p>It's a book that will let you know all the big names in science over that time and how those names were related to Marie Curie in either or other way. It enlighten you about the relationship between Marie and Pierre which it was so unique from my perspective.</p>

									<p>I highly recommend this book to be read in english, Barbara Goldsmith made a great job to write the book at a level that everybody can understand it. I loved the simplistic way she use to explain things but at the same time quite profound.</p>

									<h4>The Code Book by Simon Singh</h4>

									<p>Probably this is one those books that comes rapidly to your mind when you think about impressive ritch content because Simon has made a great job explaining really complicated things into levels that can be digestable by any people regardless their profession. This is not a book that I recommend to read when you are about to sleep, if you really want to soak all the amazing information up. </p>
									
									<p>If you are non-native english speaker and would like to really have a base knowledge on cryptography this source will enlighten you with all kind of phrases that you can use in your day-to-day but also at same time allowing you to know the several cases thrhoughout history where cryptography played a pivotal role in humanity. I found Simon words and ideas pretty tasty even though I'm  way too far away to be an expert on the cryptography discipline.</p>

									<p>There is an entire chapter dedicated to approach how Enigma machine was created, how does it work and how people at <a href="https://bletchleypark.org.uk/our-story/the-challenge/enigma">Bletchley</a> ended it up in crack it. Furthermore, there is some interesting facts about how poles paved the way to reach to the end results and so on.</p>

									<p>Also, you will get the door open to several characters throughout the entire history that will blown our mind as Mary Queen Scots, the Navajos. Also the author provides great examples of <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/NSF-4/Tutorial/VIG/Vig-Frequency-Analysis.html" target="_blank">frequency analysis</a> and how the <a href="https://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/vigenere_square_tool.html" target="_blank">Vigenère cipher</a> works.</p>
									
									<p>This book is for all engineers that are looking for answers when they closely work with microcontrollers that feature some sort of secure element on the silicon die, specially if you are working in IoT applications where devices are all connected to the world web or when you sign off a commit using your GPG key :).</p>
